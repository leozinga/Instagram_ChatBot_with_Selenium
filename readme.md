Some help for you:

-> You can change the chatbot answers, questions into script.

-> If your chromedriver not be oppened, do it:
bot.open_chrome()
and
bot.connect_chrome()

-> else, just do it:
bot.connect_chrome()

-> So, go to your instagram, log in, open your inbox and do it:
bot.auto_answer()

-> And the bot will already be working. :D

============= WARNING ===============

    This script work with selenium, so,
it was done with a PORTUGUESE elements.
    If your chrome is with any other
language, you need modify this script.
